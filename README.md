# 3D-Nvidia-PhysX-Renderer
This is 3D Nvidia PhysX Renderer project. I am using this project to learn Nvidia PhysX SDK via a basic 3D renderer written by myself.

Project has dependencies on specific libraries which are Nvidia Physics SDK, Assimp, GLFW, GLM, Assimp, Glad, STB, Imgui and SFML.
Unfortunately this dependencies resolved by package manager called vcpkg so project does not contain necessary headers, source and binaries.
An individuals that wants to run the project, must resolve dependencies by themselves.

Project exclude advanced graphics techniques to in sake of learning 3D physics.
Although project contains some OpenGL code, anyone with no prior 3D Programming knowledge can understand Physics concepts.
